# YAMRA
Welcome to **YAMRA**, **Y**et **A**nother **M**ono**R**epo **A**ttempt.

I'll write the history of it in reverse order. Newest first.

## History (in reverse order)

You want to add `git` as a versioning system to watch like a historian hawk over your files.

```git init && git add . && git commit -m "feat: start of YAMRA"```

Followed by:

```npm init -y```

to create a default `package.json` file.

You want to create a place for the project to feel comfortable:

```mkdir yamra && cd $_```
